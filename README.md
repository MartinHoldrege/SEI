Analysis of sagebrush ecological integrity 

**A note on git:**

This repository includes google earth engine code (scripts with .js ending),
as well as R scripts. Note that the 'main' branch was renamed to 'master',
because I couldn't get GEE to work with the repository. It doesn't seem like
you can (at least easily), change branches within the GEE code editor.

Analysis of sagebrush ecological integrity 

**A note on git:**

This repository includes google earth engine code (scripts with .js ending),
as well as R scripts. Note that the 'main' branch was renamed to 'master',
because I couldn't get GEE to work with main. It doesn't seem like
you can (at least easily), change branches within the GEE code editor. 

To push and pull from GEE, using:
`git push usgs_gee master`
or
`git pull usgs_gee master`

This is after the origin_gee alias has been created.
